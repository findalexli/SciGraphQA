For example, if the model is used to translate a text from one language to another, it may be more likely to produce an exact copy of the source text if the training data contains a lot of copy noise. This could lead to errors in the translation.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some possible solutions to this problem?\\nAnswer: One possible solution is to use a model that is not as smooth.

Specifically, the rate requirements of the two PUs are symmetric, i.e., α = 0.5, in Fig. 2 and asymmetric with α = 0.1 in Fig. 3. For comparison, two different primary rate requirements with K = 1 and K = 3 are simulated for each scenario. From Fig. 2, we find that when the target sum-rate of the PUs is small (R = R0), the three considered two-way relay strategies perform closely from both the primary and secondary user’s perspectives. However, when the target primary sum-rate is high (R = 3R0), the DF-XOR relay strategy performs the best, and the DFSUP relay strategy outperforms the AF relay strategy. This indicates that under the symmetric scenario, the secondary node C would prefer to re-generate the primary signals when it wants to maximize the secondary transmission rate since the destination noise at the secondary node C is not accumulated for the subsequent transmission. Moreover, combining the information using XOR is better than using superposition since the power of the secondary node C can be used more efficiently in the DF-XOR relay strategy. However, under the asymmetric condition, we observe from Fig. 3 that the DF-SUP relay strategy performs better than two other strategies, and the AF relay strategy begins to outperform the DF-XOR strategy when K = 1. This is because when RA 6= RB , the bemaforming design for DF-XOR in (24) should make the achievable primary transmission rate larger than the maximizer of RA and RB , which degrades the system performance. While for the DF-SUP strategy, since different primary messages are encoded individually, the power can be allocated to two primary messages more flexibly, which saves the power and improves the performance of the SU. For the outage performance of the PU, we find that when the rate requirements of the PUs are small, i.e., K = 1, the outage approaches zero for all the strategies. As the rate requirements increase, i.e., K = 3, the outage of the primary transmission is increased significantly. In general, the AF relay strategy has a higher outage probability due to the accumulation of the back-propagated noise.

This introduces issues for practitioners working with numerous data sets or those without enough expertise in the subject area to interpret the results. Another issue that arises in practice is that the algorithmic implementation of existing time series analysis tools is nontrivial.

However in practice there are limitations to using mutual information to analyze data without the operator intervention to sift through the minima and choose the first ’prominent’ one. This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with τ = 11. Further, the mutual information function approach may also fail if the mutual information is monotonic. This is a possibility since there is no guarantee that minima exist for mutual information3.

The policies differ in the way they prioritize the clients. The PRR policy prioritizes the client with the higher probability of successful transmission, while the MLG policy prioritizes the client with the lower probability of successful transmission.

Figure 9 shows a large discrepancy: at low pnoise the model underestimates the probability of copying (i.e., too few of the produced samples are exact copies of the source), while at high noise levels it overestimates it. Moreover, since our model is smooth, it can assign non-negligible probability mass to partial copies5 which are not present in the training data. When we consider both partial and exact copies, the model correctly reproduces the amount of copy noise present in the training data. Therefore, although the model appears to under-estimate some hypotheses at low copy rates, it actually smears probability mass in the hypothesis space.

For example, if the model is used to translate a text from one language to another, it may be more likely to produce an exact copy of the source text if the training data contains a lot of copy noise. This could lead to errors in the translation.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some possible solutions to this problem?\\nAnswer: One possible solution is to use a model that is not as smooth. This would reduce the probability of the model assigning non-negligible probability mass to partial copies that are not present in the training data.

This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum.

This introduces issues for practitioners working with numerous data sets or those without enough expertise in the subject area to interpret the results. Another issue that arises in practice is that the algorithmic implementation of existing time series analysis tools is nontrivial. This hinders these tools from being autonomously applied to large datasets. For example, the first minimum of the MI function is often used to determine τ . However in practice there are limitations to using mutual information to analyze data without the operator intervention to sift through the minima and choose the first ’prominent’ one. This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with τ = 11. Further, the mutual information function approach may also fail if the mutual information is monotonic. This is a possibility since there is no guarantee that minima exist for mutual information3.

This is done in order to better understand the data and to identify any patterns or trends that may be present. The sampling is done adaptively, meaning that the frequency of sampling is adjusted based on the current data. This ensures that the most important data points are collected, while also avoiding unnecessary sampling that would waste resources.\\n\\nQuestion: What are the benefits of using adaptive sampling?\\nAnswer: There are several benefits to using adaptive sampling. First, it can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be collected. This is important for applications where data storage or bandwidth is limited. Second, adaptive sampling can help to improve the accuracy of the data analysis. This is because the most important data points are collected, which helps to identify patterns and trends that may be missed with other sampling methods. Finally, adaptive sampling can help to reduce the cost of data collection. This is because less data needs to be collected, which saves time and money.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some of the challenges associated with using adaptive sampling?\\nAnswer: There are a few challenges associated with using adaptive sampling. First, it can be difficult to determine how to adjust the sampling frequency. This is because the optimal sampling frequency will vary depending on the specific application and the data being collected. Second, adaptive sampling can be computationally expensive. This is because the sampling frequency needs to be adjusted frequently, which can require a lot of processing power. Finally, adaptive sampling can introduce bias into the data analysis. This is because the sampling frequency is adjusted based on the current data, which can lead to the collection of more data from some areas than others.\\n\\nQuestion: How does the graph illustrate the benefits of adaptive sampling?\\nAnswer: The graph illustrates the benefits of adaptive sampling by showing how the sampling frequency is adjusted based on the current data.

This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with τ = 11.

When we consider both partial and exact copies, the model correctly reproduces the amount of copy noise present in the training data. Therefore, although the model appears to under-estimate some hypotheses at low copy rates, it actually smears probability mass in the hypothesis space. Overall, this is the first concrete evidence of the model distribution not perfectly fitting the data distribution.', 'response': '\\n Question: What is the purpose of the graph?\\nAnswer: The graph is used to visualize the rate of copy of the source sentence (exact and partial) as a function of the amount of copy noise present in the model’s train data. This information is important for understanding how the model performs when it is trained with different levels of noise.\\n\\nQuestion: What are the key takeaways from the graph?\\nAnswer: The key takeaways from the graph are that the model underestimates the probability of copying at low pnoise levels and overestimates it at high noise levels. This is because the model is smooth and can assign non-negligible probability mass to partial copies that are not present in the training data.\\n\\nQuestion: What are the implications of these findings?\\nAnswer: These findings have implications for the use of the model in practice. For example, if the model is used to translate a text from one language to another, it may be more likely to produce an exact copy of the source text if the training data contains a lot of copy noise. This could lead to errors in the translation.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some possible solutions to this problem?\\nAnswer: One possible solution is to use a model that is not as smooth. This would reduce the probability of the model assigning non-negligible probability mass to partial copies that are not present in the training data. Another possible solution is to use a different training procedure that does not introduce as much copy noise.', 'title': 'Analyzing Uncertainty in Neural Machine Translation', 'abstract': 'Machine translation is a popular test bed for research in neural\\nsequence-to-sequence models but despite much recent research, there is still a\\nlack of understanding of these models.

This is because the model is smooth and can assign non-negligible probability mass to partial copies that are not present in the training data.\\n\\nQuestion: What are the implications of these findings?\\nAnswer: These findings have implications for the use of the model in practice. For example, if the model is used to translate a text from one language to another, it may be more likely to produce an exact copy of the source text if the training data contains a lot of copy noise. This could lead to errors in the translation.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some possible solutions to this problem?\\nAnswer: One possible solution is to use a model that is not as smooth.

This introduces issues for practitioners working with numerous data sets or those without enough expertise in the subject area to interpret the results. Another issue that arises in practice is that the algorithmic implementation of existing time series analysis tools is nontrivial. This hinders these tools from being autonomously applied to large datasets. For example, the first minimum of the MI function is often used to determine τ . However in practice there are limitations to using mutual information to analyze data without the operator intervention to sift through the minima and choose the first ’prominent’ one. This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with τ = 11. Further, the mutual information function approach may also fail if the mutual information is monotonic. This is a possibility since there is no guarantee that minima exist for mutual information3.

In constrained\\ncounting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting\\nfunction, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained\\nsampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting\\nfunction, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints.\\nConsequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense\\ntheoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however,\\noffered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or\\napproaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice.\\n  In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for\\nconstrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic\\ntechnique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial\\nreasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The\\nresulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle\\nformulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from\\nthe prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of\\nvariables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal\\nForm (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized\\nApproximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By\\nexploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the\\ndistribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we\\nintroduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR\\nconstraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as\\ntwo orders of magnitude.\", 'q_a_pairs': [['What is the purpose of the graph?', 'The graph is used to measure the quality of approximation of the approximate counts returned by ApproxMC2.

This introduces issues for practitioners working with numerous data sets or those without enough expertise in the subject area to interpret the results. Another issue that arises in practice is that the algorithmic implementation of existing time series analysis tools is nontrivial. This hinders these tools from being autonomously applied to large datasets. For example, the first minimum of the MI function is often used to determine τ . However in practice there are limitations to using mutual information to analyze data without the operator intervention to sift through the minima and choose the first ’prominent’ one. This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with τ = 11. Further, the mutual information function approach may also fail if the mutual information is monotonic. This is a possibility since there is no guarantee that minima exist for mutual information3.

This introduces issues for practitioners working with numerous data sets or those without enough expertise in the subject area to interpret the results.

This is due to possibility that the mutual information function can have small kinks that can be erroneously picked up as the first minimum. Figure 3a shows this situation, where the first minimum of the mutual information function for a periodic Lorenz system is actually an artifact and the actual delay should be at the prominent minimum with τ = 11.

This is likely due to the fact that pages that are able to survive the first day are more likely to be of high quality and interest to users, which makes them more likely to be shared and viewed.\\n\\nQuestion: What are the implications of the graph for the study of page diffusion in WM?\\nAnswer: The graph provides valuable insights into the dynamics of page diffusion in WM. It shows that the majority of pages in WM have a short life time, but that the pages that are able to survive the first day are likely to stay alive for a longer time. This suggests that the key to successful page diffusion in WM is to create pages that are of high quality and interest to users.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some of the limitations of the graph?\\nAnswer: The graph does not provide information about the specific reasons why pages die in WM. It is possible that some pages die because they are not of high quality, while others die because they are not shared or viewed by users. Additionally, the graph does not provide information about the long-term life time of pages in WM. It is possible that some pages that survive the first day eventually die, while others continue to live for a long time.\\n\\nQuestion: What are some of the potential applications of the graph?\\nAnswer: The graph could be used to improve the design of page diffusion algorithms in WM. For example, the graph could be used to identify the factors that contribute to the survival of pages, and these factors could then be used to develop algorithms that are more effective at promoting page diffusion. Additionally, the graph could be used to identify the pages that are most likely to die, and these pages could then be targeted by special promotion efforts.', 'title': 'On Diffusion-restricted Social Network: A Measurement Study of WeChat\\n  Moments', 'abstract': 'WeChat is a mobile messaging application that has 549 million active users as\\nof Q1 2015, and \"WeChat Moments\" (WM) serves its social-networking function\\nthat allows users to post/share links of web pages.

Therefore, there is a trade-off between security and latency that must be considered when designing Tor.\\n\\nQuestion: What other factors could affect the fraction of attacker-free (entry, exit) pairs?\\nAnswer: The fraction of attacker-free (entry, exit) pairs could be affected by a number of factors, including the number of users on Tor, the number of guards, the distribution of guards, and the behavior of attackers. Future research is needed to investigate the impact of these factors on the security of Tor.', 'title': 'Measuring and mitigating AS-level adversaries against Tor', 'abstract': 'The popularity of Tor as an anonymity system has made it a popular target for\\na variety of attacks.

For the ReLU-s, the activation function is simply the max between 0 and the linear projection of the input. Hence, it has two modes of operation, it is either in the linear regime or the saturated regime. Obviously, no gradient flows through a saturated unit, hence a particular simple mechanism for locking a network in a suboptimal solution is to have a subset of datapoints such that all units (e.g. on a given layer) are saturated, and there is no gradient for fitting those points.
